# Attendance Management System

## Abstract
Attendance Management System is a desktop application developed for daily student attendance in schools, colleges, and institutes. This system allows faculty to access attendance information of a particular student in a particular class, sorted by the operators provided by the teacher. It also helps in evaluating the attendance eligibility criteria of a student. The purpose of developing the attendance management system is to computerize the traditional way of taking attendance and to generate reports automatically at the end or in-between sessions.
