# Attendance Management System

## Abstract
Attendance Management System is a desktop application developed for daily student attendance in schools, colleges, and institutes. This system allows faculty to access attendance information of a particular student in a particular class, sorted by the operators provided by the teacher. It also helps in evaluating the attendance eligibility criteria of a student. The purpose of developing the attendance management system is to computerize the traditional way of taking attendance and to generate reports automatically at the end or in-between sessions.

## Overview or Problem Definition
Attendance Management System has two main modules for proper functioning:

    1. The first module is admin, which has the right to create space for a new batch, make entries of new faculty, update subjects if necessary, and send notices.     
    2. The second module is handled by the user, who can be a faulty or an operator. Users can make daily attendance, generate reports, and take attendance based on the subject and month or class.       

## Conclusion
The Attendance Management System is a solution to all problems related to attendance and fee status. It reduces manual data entry and provides greater efficiency. The user interface is user-friendly and can be easily used by anyone, and all details can only be seen by verified users. The system accurately performs all tasks and can be implemented in various colleges and schools.
